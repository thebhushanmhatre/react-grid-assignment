# React Grid Assignment

## Assignment: Frontend Dashboard with AG Grid

At FactWise, we use client-side AG Grid for all our tables and grids. We’d like you to create a robust and scalable functional dashboard using AG Grid that can handle large data sets efficiently.

### Requirements:

- Create a dashboard displaying tabular data using AG Grid in React (client-side rendering).
- Use the sample dataset attached (20 rows) ([Stored locally for the sake of this assignment](./src/data/factwiseData.json))
- Feel free to be as creative as you can, while keeping the layout clean and professional.

### Comments

Find my comments in following files

- [Column Definitions](`src/hooks/useColDefs.tsx`)
- [Employees (Home) Page](`src/pages/Employees/Employees.tsx`), where the grid is
- [Employee Details Page](`src/pages/EmployeeDetails/EmployeeDetails.tsx`). where details of each row can be shown
